                        Paintless dent repair (PDR) is suitable for repairing minor dents caused by factors such
                        as hail, door dings, and small creases. However, more significant dents or those with paint

                        A: The duration of dent repairs can vary depending on the size, location, and complexity of the
                        dent. Minor dents may be repaired within a few hours, while larger or more complex dents may
                        require additional time. Our technicians will provide you with an estimated timeframe based on
                        the specific repair needs of your vehicle.

                    <div class="answer" id="ans3">
                        A: With paintless dent repair (PDR), the risk of affecting your vehicle's paint is minimal. The
                        technique focuses on manipulating the dent from the underside of the panel, preserving the
                        original paintwork. However, in cases where paint damage is present, additional steps may be
                        necessary to restore the finish.
